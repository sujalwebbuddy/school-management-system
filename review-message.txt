Dear Reviewer,
I am pleased to submit my comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) platform for your consideration. This enterprise-grade educational software includes advanced multi-tenant architecture, AI-powered features, and complete monetization capabilities designed to help buyers effectively operate and scale educational institutions.

One of the key components is the built-in subscription system with tiered pricing (Primary, High School, University), where educational institutions can choose plans based on their needs. This creates multiple revenue streams through different subscription tiers, feature access levels, and potential add-on services.

The platform features advanced AI capabilities including person detection for security, intelligent content analysis, and automated assessment tools. It includes comprehensive payment processing with Stripe integration, cloud file storage with AWS S3, real-time communication with Socket.io, and enterprise-grade analytics.

I have ensured high code quality, clear project structure, and comprehensive documentation covering installation, deployment, API usage, and customization. All development has been carried out following Envato's official Node.js guidelines and best practices, with proper error handling, security measures, and scalable architecture.

The platform is production-ready with multi-tenant SaaS architecture supporting unlimited organizations, each with isolated data and custom domains. It includes role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student), comprehensive educational features (homework, exams, attendance), and advanced integrations.

I hope you find this educational platform valuable and well-crafted for the marketplace.
Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any updates required from my side.
Thank you.
